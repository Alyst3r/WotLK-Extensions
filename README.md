###Patcher.exe
In essence, it's WoWFix335 by Robinsch, so most credits to him:

Most of patch content should probably be credited to FrostAtom, AwesomeWotlk is where I've got dll loading from:
https://github.com/FrostAtom/awesome_wotlk/blob/main/src/AwesomeWotlkPatch/Patch.h
Exe header data recalculated using CFF Explorer VIII:
