# WotLK-Extensions
Client extension project, independent from TSWoW.

### Patcher.exe
In essence, it's [WoWFix335](https://github.com/robinsch/WoWFix335) by Robinsch, so most credits to him.  
  
Most of patch content should probably be credited to FrostAtom, [AwesomeWotlk](https://github.com/FrostAtom/awesome_wotlk/blob/main/src/AwesomeWotlkPatch/Patch.h) is where I've got dll loading from.  
  
Exe header data recalculated using [CFF Explorer VIII](https://ntcore.com/explorer-suite/).
